rately finished, a black outline filled up and heightened
with a red pigment, into the composition of which lead
seems to have entered largely. Many of these initial let·-
ters represent the heads of birds, snakeS‚ and other animals,
intertwined in the intricate manner which appears so fre-
quently upon the sculpture as well as in the manuscripts
of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors. The appearance of the
writing, without being so beautiful as that of the Durham
Gospels (Cott. MS. Nero, D 1v.), or the Psalter of the same.

of that name who succeeded his brother Ecgfrid in
A.D. 685.ι If by this it be meant that the present copy

died in 705, H. Ε. v. xviii.

2 Since Aldfrid was educated by
the monks of Iona, and embraced
those views which distinguished
that society from the emissaries of
Gregory, it is probable that the
Ritual which he would adopt would
be that of Britain, not Rome.
