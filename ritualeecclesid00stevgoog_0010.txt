PREFACE.

The Anglo-Saxon Ritual, its importance‚ 5 1, Ως its defective condition,
§ 3 ; description of the Durham manuscript, 5 4 ; called ‘ the Ritual
of King Alfrid,’ 5 5; how far probable, 5 6; its deficiencieS, 5 7;
its errorS, 5 83 its interlinear Saxon Gloss, 5 9.

ᾗ 1. THE volume now presented to the public containS,

as its title stateS, the Anglo-Saxon Ritual belonging to
the Cathedral Church of Durham.
. This work, from the institution of the Society through
whose instrumentality it is now printed, was naturally
regarded by its members as having many claims upon
their peculiar attention. The religious services of the
ancient kingdom of Northumbria, the most cultivat-
ed, because the most learned of the states into which
Saxon England was divided, are to be understood from it
alone; the 'philologist is assisted in his investigation into
the nature of the language spoken by the natives of that
district by examining its interlinear gloss3 and through
it some insight may be gained respecting superstitions
which lingered, when it was written, amongst a people as
'yet scarcely converted from the adoration of Thor and of
Woden. “

§ 2. But the interest attached to the volume is by no
means of an exclusively local nature. No inquiry into
the character of the Ritual adopted by the Saxon church
can be decided without examining the component parts
and general tendency of the present work3 and the state
of the Christian world generally may be illustrated from
