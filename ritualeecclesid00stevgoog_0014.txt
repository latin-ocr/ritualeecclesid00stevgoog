PREFACE. ⁴xi

ᾗ 7. It has already been remarked that the manu-
script is imperfect. The first gathering, containing the
services from the Nativity of our Lord to the Epiphany,¹
is lost, and an occasional hiatus is here and there per-
ceptible throughout the volume.² Towards the end, the
contents are of a very miscellaneous nature, successive
scribes having taken advantage of its blank pages (or
made them blank by erasure3) to enter upon them, as
into a kind of commonplace-book‚ an unconnected as·
semblage of hymns, exorcisms, tables of contractions
used in civil law, etc. It is a misnomer, therefore,
to apply the title of ‘ the* Anglo-Saxon Ritual ’ to the
whole volume, although it would not be easy to point
out the exact line where the -Ritual ends and the
extraneous matter has its commencement.

§ 8. Itis unnecessary to adduce proofs of the asser-
tion which we have made respecting the extreme incor-
rectness of the Latin text3 they will present themselves
to the reader before he has advanced through many
pages, Although the greater part of these are so gross
that it would have been no difficult task to have cor-
rected them, yet there are otherS, especially in those in-
stances in which the present manuscript differs from the

ed in a contemporaryhand on the
bottom margin of a leaf,) we may
naturally conclude that it really
was transcribed for their use, al-
though the exact time when be
doubtful.

1 The corresponding passage in
the Sacramentary of Gregory is
0112P·Sssg·pp· lll, 138, etc.

³ An erasure of four linesi, not
filled up, occurs on fol. 21,- b.

(p. 44, aster n. 5.) One of similar
extent on fol. 22, b. (p. 46, after
n. 6.) A rubrio of some length
has been spunged out (the red ink
being a thick pigment) from fol.
38, b. (p. 80.) Throughout the
volume many leaves occur, the
contents of which evidently have
been erased to supply new material
to the scribes who compiled the
present volume.
